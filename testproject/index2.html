                                <h4 class="title"><a href="#">How Website Redesigning Is Essential for Your Business Growth</a></h4>
                                <p class="mb-30">Your site is often the first point of contact for prospective customers or partners. No one wants to invest in something that feels dated, so this is the point when people decide whether the products or services are worthy to spend their time or money on it. Therefore, it is more important than ever to keep your website unique and up-to-date to make sure you are leaving the right impression. Read on to understand when a business need website redesigning and how it can be beneficial for your business.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b>How often should a website be revamped?</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Although minor updating can keep your website interesting, a complete overhaul is necessary once in a while. It is observed that the ideal time to revamp a website is every two to three years. Usually, new UX principles have been developed in that time, consumer demand has changed, or your brand has undergone some changes. All these are grounds to review the goals and experience of your website.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b>When does your business need website redesigning?</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30"> Below are some of the reasons why you might want to think about revamping your website:</p>
                                <p><b>1. Website doesn’t live up to the expectations.</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30"> First and foremost, the website does not live up to expectations! Yes, this is the most apparent reason for you to consider changing your website. You may think your website looks excellent and everything is running well, but do you see the results you hoped for? Are you able to achieve your desired conversion rates, sales, or other objectives? If not, it is not operating effectively and it might be time to make some changes!</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">The primary goal here would be to determine what is wrong with the website and why it isn’t engaging well with your visitors. You can start by looking at the conversion rate and the ratio of visitors to leads to see what went wrong. You should also monitor visitor behaviour on your website by observing the sections that grab their attention for longer periods of time and the sections they are skimming past quickly.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Additionally, keep an eye on whether the landing page of your website is inviting enough to persuade users to visit the site subsequently or not. Because this is where visitors decide whether or not to continue using your website, the landing page is crucial.</p>
                                <p><b>2. Content plan needs some work.</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">As can be observed, today’s sales and conversions depend heavily on content. Additionally, content can aid in improving a website’s position in search engine results. Therefore, every marketer today requires a smart content strategy that prioritizes diversity and quality over quantity. And because it hosts the content, the website has a significant role.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Therefore, it is advisable to restructure your website to accommodate the new content, especially if you are transforming your content strategy significantly. Even high-quality information would be useless if no one can access it. Therefore, the content needs to be discoverable by search engines through indexing and effective implementation of SEO strategies.</p>
                                <p><b>3. Website no longer represents the brand accurately.</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">A crucial justification for website revamping, there is no question that your website is useless if it does not effectively represent your business, convey a strong brand image, and capture the soul of your brand. Leveling the playing field requires small businesses and entrepreneurs to stand out among their more established rivals, which can only be done with a better brand image. Therefore, now is the time to come up and update your website.</p>
                                <p><b>4. Website has outdated third-party tools.</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Websites increasingly use third-party solutions that enable businesses to add new functionality to their platforms, most frequently WordPress sites. These well-liked resources include scripts for integrating eCommerce plugins, social media feeds, and exit-intent popups. But what happens if they eventually stop being helpful and start to cause more harm than good? If the case is that third-party tools are no longer adding value to your website performance, it is essential to upgrade the outdated tools to improve audience engagement and sales.</p>
                                <p><b>5. Unresponsive website that is losing smartphone users.</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">The age of responsive websites is now. In the current digital-driven market, it has now become of utmost crucial to have a website design that is adaptable to all devices. So, if your website analysis shows that a sizeable portion of your website traffic comes from smartphone users, it’s high time that you switch to a responsive design.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">People nowadays hardly use desktop computers to shop online. Therefore, it is likely that your website visitors make use of a variety of mobile devices like smartphones, laptops, and tablets. A responsive web design offers an excellent user experience and allows users to quickly explore your website across all these distinctive devices. Additionally, Google, through its Mobile-Friendly Test, is now letting users know whether or not your website is responsive or, more specifically, mobile-friendly. </p>
                                <p class="mb-30">If your website is not mobile-friendly and is also seeing a more significant bounce rate than usual, it signifies that you are losing a substantial chunk of your traffic. You will lose out on crucial leads immediately, impacting your bottom line. Your credibility, lead generation, click-through rate, and revenues will all inevitably be impacted. So, a successful website redesign will take care of this problem; lowering your bounce rate, and boosting conversions.</p>
                                <p><b>6. Website loading time exceeds three seconds.</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Run your site through any of the speed testing tools to determine the website loading time. If it takes longer than three seconds, now is an as good time as any to optimize its speed. As per 2016 Google research, 53 percent of mobile visitors leave the website if it takes more than three seconds to load. </p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Moreover, as per a 2019 research study by Portent, the website conversion rates drop by 4.42 percent with each additional second that the website takes to load its page. In a nutshell, it won’t matter if your products, services, and website content are fantastic in the end, a slow website may ultimately be the downfall of your otherwise amazing business website.</p>
                                <p><b>7. Website is generating low returns and high bounce rates.</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Does your website traffic keep on diminishing while your bounce rate seems to be on a rise? Is your conversion almost null? There are times when even if you have invested lakhs in website development, it doesn’t seem to yield any significant results. In this situation, revamping a website is the solution. Get started on your website analysis, monitor the key areas that require improvements, and start revamping!</p>
                                <p><b>8. Benefits of Updating Your Website</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b>1. Long-term more cost-effective</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">A complete redesign enables you to get it right from the outset rather than spending money on temporary or band-aid fixes. Spend time auditing your current website and looking for ways to enhance the usability and user experience. Conversions and income may rise as a result.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b>2. A unified brand identity</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">A lone individual rarely manages a website. Even if they are, it’s still uncommon for updates to maintain consistency with your brand’s identity over months or years. A website redesign allows you to stand back and ensure your brand is presenting itself in a unified manner.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b>3. Enhanced website performance and SEO</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Website redesigns are an ideal moment to add relevant SEO keywords to improve site performance. Just like when you review your brand identity, ensure the information on your website corresponds to what users are looking for and that they are able to discover your website through the optimized content.</p>

                                <p><b>Difference between performance and digital marketing </b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Links, converters, and sales are all important metrics in performance marketing because they demonstrate the effectiveness of a campaign. Reach, branding, and awareness on digital platforms and across devices are all part of digital marketing. All of these skills are necessary for a successful career in digital marketing. </p>
                                <p class="mb-30">The goal of performance marketing is to get customers to take a specific action, like purchasing or signing up for a service. Through all online marketing activities, digital marketing aims to bring in new customers for a business (such as through social media and email marketing). </p>
                                <p class="mb-30">You can market and sell your start-up digitally using digital marketing techniques that have been around for a long time. Performance marketing was unique at first because it was easy to measure and focused on getting results. It’s now possible to track and measure campaign activities, which means that campaign analysis and optimization can now be done, which is good.</p>
                                <p><b>3 Types of Campaigns Working in the performance market</b></p>
                                <p>Implementation of performance marketing has three distinct groups, each of which has a stake in trying to promote an effective advertising campaign. Included are:</p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b>1.	Advertisers: </b>We recommend using performance marketing if you want to create leads and build sales. Buyers regularly check out websites and social media sites. Linked TVs and audible platforms can also receive streaming content. Cross-channel marketing is the method by which a marketing company reaches and interacts with its intended audience on the Internet.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b>2.	Publishers: </b>You can reach a wider audience by advertising on multiple platforms. Starting with traditional banner ads (display), you can move on to social media, paid search, and CTV ads. With these publishing houses, advertisers can bid on ad space to reach the specific audience they want to reach.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b>3.	Agencies & Trading Desks:</br> Media purchases and sales are handled by advertising agencies and financial companies on behalf of their clients. Audiences, a programmatic trading desk, gives you one-stop access to various DSPs for programmatic, lookup, and social advertising.</p>
                                <p><b>What are the goals of performance marketing?</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">The principle for a performance marketing plan should mainly be greater marketing and company goals. These aims partially support each other but also start competing with one another. If you’re just starting to get to know a customer, you can use performance marketing to your advantage.</p>
                                <p><b>Top Performance marketing strategy </b></p>
                                <p>For the best results in performance management marketing today, use the following tactics:</p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b>Dynamic retargeting:</b> a business can reach customers who have previously purchased from them. Social networks, browsers, or display ads can be used to sell products. In comparison with a traditional acquisition, remarketing has a much higher success rate.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b>. Influencer marketing:</b> Use social media influencers to promote your brand. Direct sales pitches can come across as cold calling. Advertisers can use Brands Collabs Manager to establish relationships with key opinion leaders.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b> Visual search:</b> Marketers must produce more visually appealing content. In addition to Google, Microsoft, and Pinterest Lens, Amazon, Microsoft, and Instagram have joined the ranks of Lens partners. Creative and technical abilities are both required for visual search.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b>YouTube shopping:</b> Ads have been added to videos and search results on YouTube. Make sure your products are in line with what people are searching for on YouTube and elsewhere. Customers searching for “Puma shoe review” can find a variety of brands.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b> Advertising on Amazon:</b> Amazon is now a serious competitor to Facebook and Google in digital advertising. Amazon can assist in increasing brand recognition and revenue. To evaluate Amazon advertising, businesses should take a look at the profit margins of their products.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b>Stories:</b> On Instagram, people can upload short videos or photos that are deleted after 24 hours. Brands must strategically use this medium to build excitement around a new product launch.</p>
                                <p><b>Best 7 Performance marketing channels </b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Many performance marketing strategies allow advertisers to buy valuable imprints or clicks. Achievement in digital marketing depends on the use of powerful visuals and layouts. Formats that pique interest keep viewers interested once they see the ad.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">. It’s common to see social media advertising used to increase traffic, involvement, and sales. Paid content is essential in a world where organic reach is dwindling. Some social media performance metrics include perceptions, likes, comments, shares, and CPM.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Most performance marketing is now done through programmatic display ads. Ads can be placed across specific publishers to use innovative contextual targeting. Publishers gather a lot of information about their readers to target their advertisements better.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">A non-advertising form of advertising is called “native advertising.” Instead, the site’s content and functionality are replicated. Customers’ viewing habits and interests are considered when native ads are shown to them. CPM advertising is the norm.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">. It’s called “search engine marketing” because it incorporates native advertising with other marketing methods such as search engine optimization (SEO). Ads at the top of search results are known as PPC advertisements. Marketers use SEO in addition to performance-based ads in an attempt to acquire organic clicks.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">. Performance marketing is becoming increasingly targeted at mobile devices. Mobile ads with high impact take advantage of the small screens on our smartphones. Aesthetics and considerate movement help them stand out in a crowded online space.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Advertisements on CTV and video: programmatic video ads work best. They can be used as a part of a video or as a transitional element between one video and another. Display ads, mobile games, and more all feature them. Through the use of video, new customers can be attracted to a product or service.</p>
                                <p><b>What are Common Uses & Major Benefits?</b></p>
                                <p>Performance marketing has the following five main advantages:</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">In the world of performance marketing, everything is trackable. It’s much easier to track ad spending and optimize media buys when you pay per impression or click. The number of views required to generate a single click is thus evident. With programmatic advertising, publishers are motivated to ensure that their ads are seen by the right people.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">An ad can get more targeted impressions and convert more effectively. Advertisers no longer pay for impressions but for actual results, which reduces the amount of money wasted. According to one study, performance marketing has a 12:1 return on investment. Adverts can be found on social media, CTV, radio, and other platforms. Trading desk advertising allows ads to be seen on a wide range of web properties at the same time.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Tracking results in real-time benefits performance marketing because it is digital. If one does better than the others, it’s okay to switch up your taglines in the middle of a campaign. Your ad placement will be optimized by the publisher based on your selected metrics. The bidding process for every platform is different, but the most common requests are for a perfect CPM and a total number of impressions. You can also set a budget on many platforms. This simplifies campaign tracking and budgeting.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b>Tips to be successful</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Don’t forget to offer publishers enticing promotional offers and conduct an audit of the site for any issues visitors may encounter. Using A/B testing in your marketing strategy is a great way to find out what works and what doesn’t.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">When used at scale, it is more cost-effective, less risky, and has a much higher return on investment than any other marketing channel. Brands, merchants, and retailers in the e-commerce sector turn to performance marketing as a new marketing tool.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">The best way to improve your affiliate program is to conduct an audit of your current strategies and programs, even if you don’t have an affiliate program yet. An outsourced management team could benefit from either being added to the mix or completely managing the project. A 16% increase in your company’s top and bottom lines can be achieved through performance marketing.</p>

                                <h4 class="title"><a href="#">Why You Need a website?</a></h4>
                                <p class="mb-30">One question we’ve been asked multiple times by professionals is, “Do I really need a website if I already have a Facebook page?”</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">No matter how amazing your Facebook page is but having a website will always be beneficial for your business</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Here are 6 reasons why we think you need a website, even if you have a Facebook page.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b>Branding & Professionalism</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Facebook is essentially a template. Branding-wise, you’re pretty much limited to your profile picture, cover photo (which has its own rules on what can and can’t go on it), apps, and Milestones (which are purely event-based).</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">We’ve always believed that a website is “your front door online.” It’s a great place to show who you really are as a brand, and you get much more control over what impression you give first-time user when you have a proper website.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Owning a website also shows professionalism and credibility. True, Facebook is free – but do you really want to be known as the business who is too cheap to build a website?</p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b>SEO & Searchability</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Your customers probably don’t know your business name before they find you. They will probably do a Google search on your business type (e.g., real estate firm in Delhi) and then click through the results that pop up on the first page list. Although Google and other search engines do index Facebook pages, a website lets you tailor your SEO settings more specifically which makes you easier to find.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30"></p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b>Competitiveness</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">If you only have a Facebook page and your competitor has both, chances are potential your customers will choose your competitor. It all goes back to credibility and professionalism. Plus, imagine if your competitor’s ad pops up on your Facebook page</p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b>Final Thoughts</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">At the end of the day, you can make your website serve your specific needs in a way that Facebook can never do for you. If you’re going to invest time into building an online presence, we strongly recommend you do it right from the start! Thanks</p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b>You Don’t (and Can’t) Own Facebook</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Another downside to Facebook being free is you don’t own it. What if Facebook suddenly decides it no longer wants to support businesses? Goodbye, Facebook page!</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Obviously, we don’t anticipate Facebook will shut down its business pages anytime soon, but the reality is that you have no control over what changes they implement. Think back to when Facebook first switched to the new business page timeline model. Remember that Welcome tab you spent so much time and effort on? Thousands of businesses had to scramble around and update their page to accommodate the new layout</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">By building your own website, you ensure a complete control over how it looks, what it does, and where it goes, along with everything else inside it.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b>Limited Features</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Facebook is also limited when it comes to sharing businesses information. The provided About page is quite restricted. If you wanted to set up separate information pages for services, pricing, team members and many more then you will likely have to create a separate app for each one. It won’t be free and it won’t be easy, so you might as well build a website!</p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b>Limited Accessibility</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Not everyone in your target market is necessarily on Facebook! Even if they were, they’d still need to Like your page. Even if they did Like your page, it doesn’t necessarily mean they will see your updates, since organic reach of Facebook pages has decreased substantially in recent months.</p>

                                <h4 class="title"><a href="#">Top Digital Marketing Trends to Grow Your Business In 2022</a></h4>
                                <p class="mb-30">Ever since remote working became the new normal, businesses have been adapting their services to suit today’s competitive online landscape. Digital marketing trends are rapidly changing to keep up with consumer demands, and marketers have to evolve in order to stay afloat.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">In this article, we’ll discuss the top digital marketing trends to help your business not only grow but thrive throughout the rest of 2022.</p>
                                <p><b>1. Authenticity Creates Connection</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Authenticity is key to creating long-term human connection. Coming out of the events of 2021, your customers crave interaction more than ever.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">After more than a year of being unable to spend time with friends, family, and colleagues in person, many people have turned to technology and human-centric businesses to bridge the gap.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">According to a 2022 Global Marketing Trends report carried out by Deloitte, more than 70% of people said they appreciated digital innovations that helped deepen their relationships with others during this time.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">When you focus your efforts on delivering an authentic brand message, your website will, in turn, become both future-proof and customer friendly.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Here are content writing tips to make your brand messaging more human and relatable.</p>
                                <p><b>2. Personalize Your Website</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Whether it’s done through content, calls to action, or marketing emails, website personalization is perhaps the most crucial digital marketing trend of 2022.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Similar to fostering authenticity, personalization is a great way to achieve a connection with your customers, while improving your website at the same time.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Website personalization boosts brand engagement, grows conversions, keeps customers coming back, and creates strong emotional connections between your consumers and your brand.</p>
                                <p><b>3. Optimize for Search Intent</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">If you want to increase brand visibility, attract more customers, and boost your sales, your website must be optimized for search intent.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Customers will often find your website while searching for a solution to a problem or looking for a specific product or service. Optimizing for search intent – the exact purpose of their search – lets you provide relevant solutions to your customers through content that has been specifically targeted towards different types of searches.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">By learning about the types of search intent and optimizing your content for a more specific type of search, you will not only boost your brand awareness but also drive more conversions, retain customers for the long-term, and remain more relevant.</p>
                                <p><b>4. Tap into Chatbot Technology</b></p>

                                <p><b>1. What Is Gray Hat SEO?</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Gray Hat SEO is a riskier form of SEO than White Hat SEO, but it also has the potential to get your website banned from search engines and the websites that link to them. Because the terms of service surrounding the issue are ambiguous, Gray Hat SEO techniques often do not fall under either the Black Hat or the White Hat category. Once you start seeing success with white hat SEO, you might want to experiment with some edge play strategies to improve your SEO rankings swiftly. This is where gray hat SEO enters the picture.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Most SEO techniques are questionable and may one day be considered a black hat. You could think of things as somewhat hazardous, but using them correctly produces fantastic benefits. You might think of these strategies as “suspicious strategies that don’t truly annoy your website visitors yet work like a charm.” Therefore, experimenting with them is nothing improper, especially if you seek desperate measures to increase your search engine traffic. Always remember that SEO Company India, which provides SEO services in India, and Digital Marketing services in India will be the right fit to do tasks like the gray hat SEO.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Let’s discuss a few methods you can apply to your website without further ado.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b>The Domain Grabbing</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Buying expired domains, known as “domain grabbing,” is another frequently used method that can produce excellent results when done correctly. Registering internet domains to sell ownership rights rather than using them personally is known as “domain snatching.” The goal of the domain thief is to sell well-liked top-level domains for a healthy profit.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">The first way to capture domains is to buy expired domains, which is quite popular since they allow you to purchase expired authority domains that have already established a strong backlink profile and are known to be reliable. When you buy expired domain names and link them back to your blog or home page, you’ll undoubtedly see an improvement in your search engine rankings. You should not purchase numerous expired domains for the sole purpose of improving your website’s SEO. However, it would be best if you did so periodically. Purchasing highly relevant expired domain names with a strong backlink profile will assist you in improving your website’s ranking on search engines like Google.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">The second way to capture domains is simply by purchasing new domains, and a new domain name seems to energize and be prepared to take you down the road in style, just like that new car fragrance. You won’t have to worry about inheriting a terrible reputation for spam or unethical business practices because you won’t have any history of being previously owned. New domains purchase of numerous expired domains to improve your website’s SEO is not recommended. However, periodically doing so can benefit an audience. It implies that you must create all necessary infrastructures, such as a website and social media accounts before you can build your marketing channels. For advantage, you might prefer an expired domain name.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b>Increase the Words in Your Content</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Have you ever written an article that was more than 3000 words long? Most people are unaware that search engines increase traffic when long content is written. Matebiz frequently writes lengthy blogs and has several other types of content available on our site. You may benefit from writing longer blog posts over a month or two if you are in a competitive industry and your blog articles are only 1000 words long. Once you understand how long-form content works, you’ll know why it is so effective. 2000-word articles seem like a lot of labor, but they function like a supercar. It is one of the best strategies to increase organic traffic to your blog to add new content to your posts. Core DNA defines long-form material as a story under 7,500 words or a novelette under 17,500 words). For your website, longer articles provide a large number of benefits. These are articles that are more than 2,000 words long. The graph below will help you understand. The overall reach of your website will naturally grow if you include more long-form content in your website. Long-form content increases social shares, organic reach, and a higher rating in SM algorithms.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Despite the common misconception, that keyword stuffing is terrible for search engine optimization, did you know that sparingly using keywords on your website can increase organic traffic and search engine rankings? If you keep an optimal keyword density for your keyword optimization, you will be most successful, even though keyword stuffing is terrible and should be avoided at all times. The article’sorganic rankings will improve if your primary keyword appears three to four times in the URL, H2, and H3 tags, and the title tag of a 1000-word article. </p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Ensure your primary keyword appears in these places: URL, H2, H3 tags, and title tags. You should use a fantastic optimization plugin like Yoast SEO at the beginning and end of your content. Keyword density is the percentage of keywords that appear on a website. You should include the keyword at least once every 100 words, or one percent, in your content if you wish to rank for it. Thus, if an article contains 1% keyword density, it has 10 keywords. You can, however, be safe by limiting your keyword density to less than 5% in a 1000-word post. You can quickly incorporate your primary keyword without sacrificing quality and readership.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b>Start Using Social Bookmarking Sites</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Using gray hat SEO involves over-submitting links to your website (new articles, old posts, other blog pages) on social bookmarking sites, but you can keep it safe by saving it to one or two at a time. Your search rankings will not be adversely affected if you only publish your most recent content or any other posts once to all social bookmarking sites. If you do it correctly, it can help your search rankings a little bit. Here are a few top social bookmarking sites where you may publish your most recent blog posts without the risk of gaining extra links.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Digg</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Folkd</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Scoop.it</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Slashdot</p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b>Engagement Is Crucial</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Social bookmarking performs better when you concentrate on fostering contact with other bloggers in your field. Unfortunately, most bloggers utilize social bookmarking sites to advertise their most recent pieces, seldom taking the time to read or share other people’s writing. How can you expect improved SEO results when you solely use social bookmarking sites for self-promotion? So be careful when using social bookmarking sites and begin interacting with other blogs there.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b>Use Distinct Headings and Descriptions</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Using the same headlines and meta descriptions is one of the most frequent errors people make while promoting their content on social bookmarking networks. What good is it to create duplicate content that uses the same headings and meta description across different social bookmarking sites while you are advertising there? It results in the same material, which could eventually lead to Google penalizing your website. As a result, while marketing your material on social bookmarking networks, be careful to generate original headings and descriptions.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">You can receive free backlinks to your website from various high-quality and relevant web directories on the internet. Then what is submission to a site directory? To create backlinks to your website, directory submission involves adding your website to various directories under a specific category. Even though there are a tonne of pointless websites where you can submit your website to directories that you should avoid, if you do diligent research, you can uncover a tonne of good guides that you can use to improve the SEO of your website.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b>How to Perform the Gray Hat SEO Techniques</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-30">You don’t gain anything by offending Google.
